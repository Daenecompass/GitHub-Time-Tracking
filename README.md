5. `:clock1: 2h | Feb 26, 2014 3pm` # => :clock1: 2h | Feb 26, 2014 3pm

6. `:clock1: 2h | Feb 26, 2014 3:20pm` # => :clock1: 2h | Feb 26, 2014 3:20pm

- Dates and times can be provided in various formats, but the above formats are recommended for plain text readability.

- Any GitHub.com support `clock` Emoji is supported:
":clock130:", ":clock11:", ":clock1230:", ":clock3:", ":clock430:", ":clock6:", ":clock730:", ":clock9:", ":clock10:", ":clock1130:", ":clock2:", ":clock330:", ":clock5:", ":clock630:", ":clock8:", ":clock930:", ":clock1:", ":clock1030:", ":clock12:", ":clock230:", ":clock4:", ":clock530:", ":clock7:", ":clock830:"


### Logging Budgets for a Issue

1. `:dart: 1w` # => :dart: 1w

2. `:dart: 1w | We cannot go over this time at all!` # => :dart: 1w | We cannot go over this time at all!
